# Vivek Srivastava

Hello! I'm Vivek, a seasoned professional with expertise as a Solution Architect, Python Django Lead Developer, and React.js TypeScript Lead Developer. I'm passionate about designing scalable solutions, leading technical teams, and staying updated with the latest in web development.

With over a decade of experience in software development, I've been at the forefront of setting up technical processes and assembling teams for budding startups. My approach has always been centered around delivering an unparalleled experience to the end-user, rather than just rolling out a product. Juggling multiple projects simultaneously, I've honed my skills in multitasking and ensuring each project receives the attention it deserves. Above all, I firmly believe in fostering a culture of continuous learning within my teams, enhancing both productivity and skill sets. My commitment lies in not just leading teams but cultivating an environment where innovation thrives.
